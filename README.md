# Agentic Ecosystem Simulation

Modular machine learning framework for **agentic simulation and decision support in complex systems**. The project explores how **transformer-based models** can be combined with **simulation-driven world models**, knowledge-based constraints, and **human-in-the-loop validation** to support robust recommendation under uncertainty.



## Project Overview

The system integrates:

* Simulation-based environment modelling
* PyTorch-based transformer architectures
* Agentic decision loops with structured context injection
* Human-in-the-loop feedback for validation and correction

This allows recommendations to be evaluated not only on predictive accuracy, but also on consistency with system dynamics and domain constraints.

## Key Features

* **World model abstraction** for simulating dynamic ecosystems
* **Transformer-based agents** for representation learning and decision support
* **Knowledge-aware context injection**, inspired by emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) ideas
* **Human-in-the-loop evaluation** to guide and constrain agent behavior
* Modular design enabling scalability and domain adaptation
